# Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse Project! 
This initiative focuses on constructing a modern data warehouse utilizing SQL Server. My primary goals include implementing robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, designing effective data models, and enabling insightful analytics. Join me as I harness the power of data to drive informed decision-making and support business intelligence.
